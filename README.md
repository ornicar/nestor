Hostel management webapp using event sourcing
---------------------------------------------

The goal is to explore 
[event-sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html), 
[CQRS pattern](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) and 
[domain-driven design](http://domaindrivendesign.org/resources/what_is_ddd).

Oh, and help a friend who owns a hotel (soon) to manage his rooms and hosts, reservations and payments.
